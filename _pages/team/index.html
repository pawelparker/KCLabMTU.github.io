            <p class="card-text">Principal Investigator</p>
            <p class="card-text">Dukka KC is the Associate Dean for Research, College of Computing;  Professor, 
                Computer Science; and Associate Director of the Institute of Computing and Cybersystems (ICC) at Michigan Technological
                University.  Born and raised in the beautiful Himalyan Country Nepal, he went to Japan for his undergraduate 
                studies. He received his B.E. in Computer Science in 2001 from the College of Engineering at Kyoto University. He then 
                received his M.Inf. and Ph.D. in Bioinformatics from Kyoto University in 2003 and 2006 respectively working under 
                Dr. Tatsuya Akutsu. Before he finished his Ph.D., he also worked as a visiting graduate student in the lab of 
                Dr. Sandor Vajda at Boston University. After finishing his Ph.D, he did his first postdoctoral fellowship at 
                Georgia Institute of Technology working under Dr. Jeffrey Skolnick. After that, he was a postdoctoral fellow 
                at UNC-charlotte in the Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics working under Dr. Dennis Livesay. 
                Subsequently, he also did another fellowship as a Cancer Research Training Award Fellow at National Cancer 
                Institute at National Institutes of Heatlh (NIH) under Dr. Byungook Lee. Subsequently,  he also 
                worked as a Bioinformatics Scientist at Center for Information Technology at NIH for Dr. Peter Munson. He then joined
                North Carolina A&T State University and was an Associate Professor and Graduate Program Director in the Department of Computational Science and Engineering at North Carolina A&T 
                State University (NCA&T) before he moved to Wichita State University in 2019. From 2019 to 2021, he was Director of Data Analytics and Associate
                Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Wichita State University.Besides his interest in
               the development of various computational approaches to various problems in bioinformatics 
                but not limited to elucidation of protein sequence, structure, function and evolution relationship, analysis of 
                Next-gen sequencing data. He is also actively involved in various initatives in improving computing infrastructure. 
                He also serves on the editorial board of BMC Bioinformatics and Frontiers in Bioinformatics Journal. In addition, he is also co-chair
                of Function COSI @ ISMB.

            <p class="card-text">PhD Student</p>
            <p class="card-text">Suresh Pokharel is a Ph.D. student at the College of Computing at Michigan Technological University. He is working as a Graduate Research Assistant at Dr. Dukka KC's research lab (KC-Lab).

He is broadly interested in computational biology, machine learning, deep learning methods, transfer learning, generative modeling, and computer vision. In his recent works, he is developing machine learning and deep learning based models to locate the various post-translational modification (PTM) in protein sequences.

Suresh received a Bachelor of Computer Engineering degree in 2017 and an M.Sc. in Computer Systems and Knowledge Engineering degree in 2021 from Tribhuvan University, Nepal. 
<!-- 
While doing his master's, he also worked as an instructor at the Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Nepal for various courses including programming languages, database management systems, machine learning, and image processing.

His undergraduate research project was handwritten signature recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network and transfer learning. He did his graduate level thesis to develop a SIFT(Scale Invariant Feature Transform) based Image Quality Assessment(IQA) technique to study the quality of High-Resolution images generated by using generative adversarial networks.

He also has several years of experience as a software engineer in the software development industry. -->
